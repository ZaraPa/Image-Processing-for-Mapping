### ðŸŽ¯ Overview
This project explores **instance segmentation with Mask R-CNN** to detect and segment animals (specifically parrots) in visually complex environments â€” such as cages, branches, and rope structures.  
It demonstrates **transfer learning**, **data augmentation**, and **fine-tuning** on a small custom dataset.

The work was done as part of the *Image Processing for Mapping Purposes (0148555)* final project, extending state-of-the-art deep learning methods for real-world image segmentation.

- **Custom Birds dataset** with JSON annotations
- **Data augmentation** (random flips, scaling)
- **Evaluation** with Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and visual results
- **Visualization utilities** for masks, bounding boxes, and overlays
