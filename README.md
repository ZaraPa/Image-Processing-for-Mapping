#Object Detection with transfer-learning & data augmentation 
###### Image processing for mapping purposes (014855) - Final Project

<p align="justify">
This project explores a cutting-edge approach in the field of neural networks known as "Instance segmentation with Mask R-CNN," which was first discovered in 2018. The objective was to successfully identify birds in a given picture, specifically parrots in complex backgrounds such as birdhouses, cages, branches, and ropes.

To tackle this challenge, we had two main options:
- <p align="justify"> Firstly, since the dataset was relatively small, we decided to use deep learning with transfer learning and data augmentation. Transfer learning allowed us to leverage pre-trained weights of an already trained model and apply those features to predict new classes.</p>
- Secondly, to detect all the birds in each image, we opted for Instance segmentation with Mask R-CNN.

Our main motivation for the project was curiosity, as we wanted to compare the performance of regular image processing methods (such as thresholding with histogram-based methods) with Instance segmentation with Mask R-CNN. We also aimed to investigate if this new approach could overcome the limitations of traditional image processing methods or even outperform them.</p>
